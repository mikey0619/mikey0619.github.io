    <h1>NBA MVP Statistics Visualization</h1>
    <p><b>Summary:</b></p>
    <p>This project gave us insight into how MVP voting is conducted in the NBA.
        By visualizing main data points from the MVP voting process, we were able to
        see what parts of voting are most important to voters. For example, the MVP
        of the year Nikola Jokic, posseses the highest number of assists of the year.
        Additionally, he does not have the highest number of passes, indicating his
        efficiency because he did not incur many turnovers. On the other side, the second
        place vote getter, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, has more shot attmepts and makes than
        Jokic, showing that scoring is a key factor in MVP voting as well. This project
        was a great way to visualize the data and see the trends in MVP voting. We recognize
        that there is more to the game than just the statistics we displayed, however we 
        believe that our visualization is a great way for a casual player to view important 
        statistics.
